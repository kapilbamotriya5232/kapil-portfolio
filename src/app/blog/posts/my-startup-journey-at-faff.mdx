My journey at faff started in the most startup way possible, I stayed at the founder's place for the first month (saving rent XD).

I thought my first day would be normal â€“ onboarding, introductions, the usual. But no, the moment I walked in, I was given an urgent task. Het explained it for 10 minutes and then just left.

I barely understood it, but I quickly realized this is how an early stage startup operates.

The pace never slowed down. I pulled all-nighters on my second and third day. Wrapped up my first week by pushing a nasty bug to production on a Saturday (and spent the entire night solving it).

## The Intensity Never Let Up

That's how my time at faff began, and the intensity never let up. Everyone was constantly in a hurry. I made some great friends (shoutout to Basu Mohin), and before I even had a chance to think about settling in, I was already part of the family.

We were always workingâ€”from the Entrepreneurs First office or even the founder's house when we had no office. We were just shipping features like a machine.

Every Sunday, I'd look back and be shocked at how much we did in just six days. And honestly? I was loving it. I had real ownership, from planning which features to build to designing and testing them myself.

## The Founders Were Crazy (In a Good Way)

The founders were crazy (in a good way). The amount of work they put in and their ideas were amazing to see (shoutout to Het Patel and @anirudh!).

It wasn't all romantic. There were burnouts and long nights spent fixing one single bug. I had so many all-nighters that felt terrible at the time.

But looking back, it was all worth it (though we could have been more efficientâ€”there's always room for improvement).

## The Growth

Looking back, I see how much I've grown. I'm more confident, more fulfilled, and have a healthier bank balance ðŸ˜†, and most importantly, I'm a much better engineer.

August 31 marked my last day at faff. Why I left? Well, that's a story for later. I'm now hunting for something where I can grow and learn while creating meaningful impact.

For the chaos, the growth, and the amazing ride,
**Thank you, faff**
