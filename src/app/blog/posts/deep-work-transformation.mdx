Back in college (now I'm not), I was a chaotic mess—disorganized, full of distractions, and my days were packed with leisure activities. I tried to escape this lifestyle, but nothing seemed to work.

Eventually, I took help from a psychologist, got diagnosed with ADHD, and started working on myself through meditation (suggested by the psychologist) and books like Atomic Habits.

But the damage from 2.5 years of chaos felt irreversible. It seemed like it would take years to fix everything.

## The Book That Changed Everything

Then I started reading **Deep Work by Cal Newport**. This book literally changed everything.

I was pretty impressed with the story of Jason Benn that's mentioned right at the start of the book. Benn was a graduate of the elite University of Virginia (and even I was in IIT—though it's a different story that I didn't graduate).

Benn was a financial consultant who left his job because he wanted to switch to being a computer programmer (and he had never written a line of code in his life). Initially, he struggled, but over time, he got better.

He used to have long 5–6 hour uninterrupted study sessions without a single distraction, and he read something like 18 books in just 2 months. He learned a completely new skill in a surprisingly short amount of time and even topped a highly competitive bootcamp program.

All of this was possible because of deep, distraction-free work. This story really inspired me.

After all this, he secured a job with about 2.5x the salary of his past job in just 6 months.

## Creating My Own Deep Work Routine

I decided to create my own plan for focused work:

- Started waking up at **3:30–4:00 AM**
- Didn't touch my phone until **8:00 AM**
- Committed to distraction-free study sessions—**2–3 hours of deep work** with zero interruptions

Even during breaks, I'd just stare at the ceiling fan, doing absolutely nothing. In those hours, I was insanely concentrated, covering vast amounts of material at an unbelievable pace.

## The Results

And in just two months, I went from being an unemployed, chaotic mess to securing an internship (it was a big deal for me)—even before finishing the Full Stack Open course I was working on.

What I thought would take years to fix only took a few months of focused effort.

## The Second Phase

Aur ab jab main dobara Deep Work padh raha hoon, I thought of sharing this story. Tab se ab tak kaafi kuch change ho chuka hai—ab main Bangalore mein hoon, in a much, much better place.

But I'm in no mood to slow down, and I wonder where this second phase of deep work will take me.
