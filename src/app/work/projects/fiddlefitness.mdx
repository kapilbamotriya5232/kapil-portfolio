I built an end-to-end, fully automated platform for Fiddle Fitness to run their online fitness business entirely through WhatsApp. The system handles the complete user journey—from discovery and payment to class reminders and feedback—creating a seamless experience for customers and a powerful management tool for the business.

### **The Automated User Journey on WhatsApp**

The entire customer interaction is handled by a chatbot I developed, following this flow:

1. **Seamless Onboarding:** A new user starts a chat and registers their details through an interactive WhatsApp form.
2. **Event Discovery:** Users can browse fitness categories (e.g., Zumba, Yoga) and view upcoming events directly in the chat.
3. **Instant Registration & Payment:** After selecting an event, the user is sent a Razorpay link to complete the payment.
4. **Automated Confirmations:** Upon successful payment, the user instantly receives a confirmation message and an invoice via email.
5. **Smart Reminders:** The system automatically sends event reminders and the unique Zoom meeting link to registered attendees before the class starts.
6. **Feedback Loop:** After the session, a message is sent to collect user ratings and feedback.
7. **Referral & Rewards System:** Users receive a unique referral code. For every successful referral, they earn "Fiddle Coins" which can be used for discounts on future events.

### **The Admin Dashboard**

To power the WhatsApp experience, I built a comprehensive web-based dashboard for the Fiddle Fitness team to manage their entire operation.

- **Event Management:** Create, update, and manage all fitness events and schedules.
- **Customer & Trainer Database:** A centralized place to view all customer data, registration history, and manage trainer profiles.
- **Financial Tracking:** Monitor payments, track revenue, and view detailed analytics on event performance.

### The platform immediately proved its value by flawlessly powering **~10 live events**. The robust, end-to-end automation managed **over 250 registrations** and onboarded **100+ new customers** without any technical issues, directly enabling the client to scale their new online business operations from day one.
