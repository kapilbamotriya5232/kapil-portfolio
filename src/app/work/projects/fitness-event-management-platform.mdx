## Challenges and Solutions

### WhatsApp Integration
Implementing a robust WhatsApp chatbot required handling various message formats and ensuring reliable message delivery. I created a message queue system to handle high volumes and prevent message loss.

### Payment Processing
Ensuring secure and seamless payment processing while maintaining user trust was critical. I implemented webhook handlers for payment verification and automatic retry mechanisms for failed transactions.

## Impact and Results
