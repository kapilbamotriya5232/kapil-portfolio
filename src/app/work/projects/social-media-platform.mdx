[**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/kapilbamotriya123/Social-media-app.git)

I developed a full-stack social media application from the ground up, designed to replicate the core functionalities of a modern platform like Instagram. The project focuses on a complete user experience—from content creation and social interaction to real-time notifications—all within a performance-optimized architecture.

### **Key Features**

- **Content & Profiles:** Users can create and share posts with photo/video uploads, customize their profiles, and view a feed of content from users they follow.
- **Social Engagement:** Implemented a full suite of interactive features, including the ability to like posts, add comments, follow other users, and bookmark posts for later.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** A notification system keeps users updated on new likes, comments, and follows through 1-minute polling.
- **Media Handling:** Integrated **UploadThing** for efficient and reliable handling of all image and video uploads.

### **Technical Highlights**

The application was architected for a fast and responsive user experience, leveraging **React Query** for phenomenal server-state management, caching, and data fetching. The stack includes **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **Lucia** for authentication, and a **PostgreSQL** database.
