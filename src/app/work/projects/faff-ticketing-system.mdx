## Overview

As a Founding Engineer at Faff Technologies, I architected and built a full-stack ticketing system that became the backbone of the company's operations and a key factor in securing seed funding. The system successfully migrated the entire company workflow from Google Sheets to a modern, scalable solution.

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Built using Next.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Docker for containerization, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Implemented AI features that automated 90% of note-taking processes, reducing manual work and improving accuracy.
- **AI Quality Assurance**: Developed an AI-powered QA process that reduced errors by 30%, ensuring higher quality outputs.
- **Intelligent Task Summaries**: Created AI-generated task summaries that accelerated new-hire onboarding by 40%.
- **Voice AI Agents**: Developed VAPI-powered voice agents in just 1.5 weeks that automated 50% of customer calls, supporting 1,000 pre-seed calls during the funding round.
- **Unstructured Data Processing**: Engineered a multi-prompt GenAI system to parse unstructured customer chats, generating structured profiles and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, VAPI, Custom LLM Integration
- **DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live updates

## Challenges and Solutions

### Migration from Google Sheets
The biggest challenge was migrating years of operational data from Google Sheets while maintaining business continuity. I designed a phased migration approach with data validation at each step, ensuring zero data loss and minimal downtime.

### AI Integration at Scale
Implementing AI features that could handle real-time processing of customer interactions required careful optimization of prompt engineering and response caching strategies. This resulted in sub-second response times while maintaining high accuracy.

### Voice Agent Development
Building voice agents that could handle complex customer queries in just 1.5 weeks required rapid prototyping and iterative testing. The solution involved creating a modular conversation flow system that could be quickly adjusted based on customer feedback.

## Impact and Results

- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual data entry by 90% through automation
- **Error Reduction**: 30% decrease in processing errors through AI QA
- **Customer Experience**: 50% of customer calls automated, improving response times
- **Business Growth**: System was instrumental in securing seed funding
- **Team Productivity**: 40% faster onboarding for new team members
- **Data Insights**: Generated actionable customer insights from previously unstructured data

## Outcome

The ticketing system became the core operational platform for Faff Technologies, handling thousands of tickets and customer interactions. The AI integrations not only improved efficiency but also provided strategic insights that helped shape product decisions and customer engagement strategies. The system's success was a key factor in the company's ability to secure seed funding and scale operations.
