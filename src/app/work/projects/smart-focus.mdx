I developed Smart Focus, a powerful Chrome extension designed to help users understand their browsing habits and eliminate distractions. The tool combines automatic time tracking with customizable focus modes to provide actionable insights and improve productivity.

### **Key Features**

- **Automatic Time Tracking:** The extension passively tracks the active time a user spends on every website, providing a clear, real-time overview of their daily browsing habits.
- **Customizable Focus Modes:** Users can create "Deep Work" sessions that activate either a blocklist (to block distracting sites like social media) or an allowlist (to permit only essential sites). Accessing a blocked site triggers a warning to keep the user on task.
- **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard visualizes all collected data, breaking down time spent by individual site and category (e.g., Work, Entertainment). This helps users easily identify their biggest time sinks.
- **In-Depth YouTube Analytics:** A unique feature that goes beyond just tracking time on `youtube.com`. It monitors which individual videos are watched, the duration of each viewing, and completion rates, offering a granular look at how a user consumes video content.

You can download the extension from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/kapilbamotriya5232/Smart-focus-chrome-ext) and follow the `README` file for a complete installation and usage guide.
